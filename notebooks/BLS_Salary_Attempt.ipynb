    "# Introduction\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "This file is meant to serve as a proof of concept for a project designed to estimate average salaries based on education and occupation, among other features, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as its base. The immediate issue is that to prove that such a project is possible, we need to join several data sets together to create one that would best facilitate machine learning techniques. This notebook file is meant to figure that out using 2023 as an example year.\n",

    "### Observations:\n",
    "It seems as though combining these datasets could happen either on the occupation code column for the wages data, which I believe is analogous to the National Employment Matrix code in the education data. Another possibility would be using the occupation text column from the wages data, which I believe is roughly analgous to the National Employment Matrix title column in the education data. This second option is less ideal as there is no guarantee that there will be exact occupation names that relate one to one between the two tables, and would likely require regex work to pull key words to relate an occupation from one table to the other. Thus, I believe it is more prudent to continue with the occupation code column, and doing processing to make them in the same form (extract the '-'), and seeing if this allows us for joining tables."

    "Overall, producing a dataframe of 363981 rows × 14 columns just for 2023 isn't the worst. Especially if it could be possible to incorporate 2020 - 2022 data as well, following the structure outlined up until now in terms of cleaning, pre and post processing. To round out this notebook as a proof of concept, I'm going to attempt some very basic preliminary predictions using machine learning techniques. I should probably just use the most basic versions of Linear Regression, RandomForest, and Gradient Boosting since that's what was mentioned in our original project proposal. I'll at least consider adding some basic cross validation, before potentially considering regularization and other techniques later, in the context of prying out the best performance we can get out of the data."
